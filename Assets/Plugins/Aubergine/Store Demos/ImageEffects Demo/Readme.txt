How to use:
Mostly, you have to attach the script to your camera.
You can combine 2 or more shaders by enabling them all at once. The rendering order is from top to bottom
of components list. That means, if you add nightvision and then bleach; nightvision will be
processed first and then bleach will be processed on top of nightvision image.

In order to see the effects in editor;
Most of the effects need you to set necessary variables as you please and press start atleast once in order to send your changes to the shader.
You must do this anytime you make changes.

These post processing effects are compatible with Unity Pro version only.
